## About Project

Reloadly's Sample Token project is a one stop repository to find codebase on various languages for get token endpoint. We are continuously working on improving our documentation and making it easier for developers to get on board. For this we have created this repository to help developers easily connect with the Reloadly Airtime API Platform.

You can find your sample code to get token in the respective folder of your language. Simply copy the code in your project and replace the API_KEY and API_SECRET with your account's keys and you are good to go.
